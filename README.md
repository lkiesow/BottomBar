BottomBar WoW Addon
===================

Bottombar shows a configurable background at the bottom of the screen, to be
used as background for action bars, chat, minimap and other addons.

The same effekt can be created by some existing good skin addons, but in
contrast to this realy lightweight addon (only 7.3kb code, no hooks, ...) they
need a lot of system resources.

commands
--------

- Use the `/bottombar` command to toggle the preferences menu.
